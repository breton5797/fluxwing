# Unit balance

How strong each unit is in stage mode, measured by `scripts/balance.mjs`. The same bot flies every unit. It aims at each gap's centre with a Gaussian error (`--aim`, default 6 px), dashes when the meter is full, and casts the skill and ultimate when ready. The numbers compare units, not players: a real player scores much more, but the order should hold.

```
npm run dev                                   # another terminal
node scripts/balance.mjs --stage 20 --runs 12 --form 0 --out docs/balance/baseline-s20-f0.json
node scripts/balance.mjs --units seraph,lumen --runs 30   # just a few units
```

`bound` is the best run's score divided by the server's endless limit, `3g² + 75g` (`fw_submit_score` in supabase/schema.sql). Above 1, the server would refuse that run. Every unit must stay well under it, at any form.

## Baseline, 2026-10-26 (stage 20, 12 runs, form I): `baseline-s20-f0.json`

| Rank | Units (mean score) | Rank mean |
|---|---|---|
| common | volt 38 · blitz 29 · nimbus 16 · titan 44 | ~32 |
| epic | mochi 42 · pixel 48 · neko 38 · buzz 43 | ~43 |
| legendary | phoenix 51 · zero 109 · raijin 37 · chrono 73 · goliath 52 · monarch 61 | ~64 |
| mythic | aegis 107 · kraken 70 · specter 90 · oracle 222 | ~122 |
| ultra | solaris 105 · pulsar 192 (open) · tempest 185 · pleiad 131 (hidden) · **aurora 1160 (hidden)** | ~149 (open units) |

Highest bound ratio: aurora 0.104. Everything else stays at or below 0.051.

Notes:
- **AURORA is an outlier.** Its lane skill turns gates into sure Perfects, which this bot exploits fully. It is hidden today. Retune it before it is released.
- **ORACLE** (mythic, 222) is already above the open ultras' mean. Its foresight saves runs, so it gets more gates and a longer combo.
- Each rank's mean rises by about x1.3 to x1.9 on the way up to ultra. Within a rank, the spread is wide (legendary 37 to 109).

## Target ladder for the ranks above ultra

Each rank's mean is about 11% above the one below, starting from the open ultras (~149). Each evolution form adds about 5%. A unit may sit ±15% around its rank's target: the four units of a rank differ in style (Perfect, dash, combo, special), not in strength.

| Rank | Score mastery (form I → V) | Target mean, form I |
|---|---|---|
| 5 celestial | ×1.10 → ×1.30 | ~165 |
| 6 nebula | ×1.20 → ×1.40 | ~184 |
| 7 void | ×1.30 → ×1.50 | ~204 |
| 8 divine | ×1.40 → ×1.60 | ~226 |
| 9 genesis | ×1.50 → ×1.70 | ~251 |

A rank's PR is ready when its four units are on target at form I and form V, and the best run's bound ratio stays below 0.25.

## Rank 5 · celestial (P1), 2026-10-26 (stage 20, 60 runs): `tier5-s20-f0.json`, `tier5-s20-f4.json`

| Unit | Form I | Form V | Best bound ratio (V) |
|---|---|---|---|
| seraph | 138 | 369 | 0.090 |
| valkyrie | 195 | 336 | 0.029 |
| lumen | 113 | 527 | 0.115 |
| halcyon | 145 | 454 | 0.178 |
| **rank mean** | **148** (target ~165) | **422** (target ~410) | |

The open ultras at form V, for reference: solaris 182, pulsar 444 (mean ~313).

- **Form V is on target.** Celestial is about 35% above the open ultras, which is about the rank step × mastery the design asks for.
- **Form I sits about 10% under target**, roughly level with the open ultras (~149). The difference shows at the higher forms, as intended for "grows with the unit's level".
- **Run-to-run noise is about ±20–25% at 60 runs.** The same settings gave seraph 161 and 122 at form I in two batches. Do not tune on one batch, and compare rank means rather than single units.
- **LUMEN scales the most** (form I ~113–138, form V ~410–550). Its combo-keep passive turns longer runs into much longer combos. Re-check it with players before rank 5 is released.
- **All runs stay at or below 0.18 of the server bound** (3g² + 75g). Re-derive the bound with the next ranks' numbers before the first rank above ultra is released.

## Rank 6 · nebula (P2), 2026-10-26 (stage 20, 60 runs): `tier6-s20-f0.json`, `tier6-s20-f4.json`

| Unit | Form I | Form V | Best bound ratio (V) |
|---|---|---|---|
| quasar | 169 | 610 | 0.159 |
| comet | 172 | 513 | 0.226 |
| zodiac | 235 | 674 | 0.072 |
| eclipse | 137 | 503 | 0.047 |
| **rank mean** | **178** (target ~165–185) | **575** (target ~470) | |

- **Form I is on target**, about 20% above celestial's measured 148.
- **Form V overshoots by about 22%**: 575 against celestial's 422, about +36%.
  - Nebula grows more with form, through mastery ×1.20 → ×1.40, `formBonus` on all four, and the skills' +10%/+10%.
  - That fits "higher ranks gain more as the unit levels", but it is steeper than the 11% rung.
  - If rank 7 repeats the pattern, re-check the server bound (`3g² + 75g`) with these numbers first. The best run so far is 0.226 of it.
- **Two review fixes moved the numbers a lot:**
  - QUASAR's beam now carries over to gates not spawned yet, so it marks its full count on a narrow screen as well.
  - QUASAR and ZODIAC keep a wider window.

  Measure again after any change to them.
- **ZODIAC is the strongest unit at both forms**; ECLIPSE is the weakest at form I.

## Rank 7 · void (P3), 2026-10-26 (stage 20, 60 runs): `tier7-s20-f0.json`, `tier7-s20-f4.json`

| Unit | Form I | Form V | Best bound ratio (V) |
|---|---|---|---|
| singular | 204 | 449 | 0.077 |
| rift | 270 | 910 | 0.132 |
| nyx | 174 | 526 | 0.145 |
| entropy | 166 | 622 | 0.161 |
| **rank mean** | **204** (target ~198) | **627** (target ~640) | |

- **Both forms are on target.** The ladder so far, rank means at form I / V:
  - celestial: 148 / 422
  - nebula: 178 / 575
  - void: 204 / 627
- **RIFT is the noisiest unit.** Its form V was 700 and 910 in two batches; it ghosts through walls, so a run either ends early or goes very long.
- **The bot underrates units that chain Perfects.** The review showed NYX could pass the server bound on a long all-Perfect run: fog up about 80% of the time, ×3, sure gates. It was fixed by:
  - no skill charge from Perfects while NYX's fog or ENTROPY's chaos runs;
  - longer cooldowns;
  - fog Perfects ×2.

  Before `TIER_OPEN` reaches 7, re-derive the bound from a hand worst case, not from these bot numbers.
